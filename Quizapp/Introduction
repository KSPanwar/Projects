Introduction:
Hey,
This project is done to learn about different CRUD operation using spring boot.
This is only the back-end of the quiz application.
We are using postgresql as the data base for our questions and to store each quiz which you are generating by hitting postrequest.
Name of the each method and class is self explanatory.

You can run the code in your personal space.
Now to configure this code for you space.
1. EDIT : Application.properties file to redirect it your server.
2. Know your question structure and edit the question class accordingly.
3. Your table name should match the DAO classes.

Thank You
